## General Course Information and Policies

 * Course name: MAT 151 Precalculus

 * Course credit hours: 3 credit

 * Course Prerequisite: MAT 124, or satisfactory performance in the math placement test administered by the math department, or permission of instructor.

 * Class time and location: Tuesdays and Thursdays 1:00pm - 2:15pm at Hubbard Hall 210.

 * Textbook: Please see the course material link above.

 * Online homework system: We will use the WileyPLUS online homework system designed for Young's Precalculus textbook. You do not need to purchase the hard copy of Young's Precalculus textbook. If you want to have that textbook as a reference, you will have the access to an electronic version of it after you have purchase the WileyPLUS access. The ISBN for the WileyPLUS standalone access card is 9781119869436.  If you have enrolled in the book bundle program, then you will automatically have access to it. Otherwise, you can purchase the access directly from the publisher. Note that it is very unlikely that any used Calculus textbook will come with the WileyPLUS access. The class key you need to self-enroll in WileyPLUS is "C95016". Please use your Utica University official name and email address to register. Do not use nickname or your private email address.

 * Calculator: We will be using a free graphing calculator app called Desmos. You can use Desmos directly by going to their website at [www.desmos.com](https://www.desmos.com/calculator). You are required to bring a computer or a tablet to the class to use Desmos. You can download Desmos at [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desmos-graphing-calculator/id653517540?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.desmos.calculator&amp;hl=en"). You are not allowed to use Desmos on a smart phone.

 * Course description: Precalculus covers elementary functions and their graphs including linear functions, quadratic functions, exponential functions, rational functions and trigonometric functions.

 * Course learning objectives (general education program): Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
   * interpret and communicate quantitative information, and mathematical or statistical concepts, using language appropriate to the context and intended audience.
   * make sense of problems and develop strategies to determine solutions using quantitative data and mathematical reasoning.
   * reason, model, and draw conclusions or make decisions with mathematical and quantitative information, including estimating and checking answers to determine reasonableness, identifying alternatives, and selecting optimal results.
   * critique and evaluate quantitative arguments that utilize mathematical, statistical, and quantitative information.

 * Attendance is mandatory. Attending class meetings will have a direct impact on your learning as well as your grade. If you miss class for any reason, you are responsible for getting the information from a classmate, and checking the course web page for any handouts and assignments. You will not be able to make up the quiz for the day if you were not in class unless you have met the makeup policy below. If you missed more than 25 percent of the class, you will automatically fail the course.

 * Makeup policy: You can only make up a quiz or an exam if all three conditions are met:
   * You have a legitimate reason (as determined by me) with documented proof. Visit of emergency rooms due to urgent health conditions is an example of legitimate reason. Attending non-academic events, such as someone's wedding is an example of non-legitimate reason.
   * You have informed me well in advanced.
   * You can only make up the quiz or the exam after the scheduled date.

## Your Role and My Role

 * Professor Xiao's role: I want you to succeed and I am here to help you succeed, but I cannot succeed for you! I have designed the structure of the course to help you learn. The class format will challenge you but it will be exhilarating and even fun at times. I will do what I think is the best to help you understand the material in the course. I hold office hours to provide you the opportunity to get additional help, and I check and respond to email frequently.

 * Student's Role:
   * You are responsible for making sense of the concepts and processes in this course. Success in mathematics is less about "ability" and more about willingness to think and to work hard to make sense of things.
   * Attend every class meeting, participate, present whenever you can and work on the assignments outside of class.
   * Please respect the ideas and opinions of others.
   * If you are having trouble, please come to office hours or make an appointment to visit me.
   * Cell phones should be off or set to vibrate. Do not place a call or send a text during class, and do not answer a phone call without first leaving the room.

## Intellectual Property

 * My lectures and course materials, including powerpoint presentations, tests, outlines, and similar materials, are protected by U.S. copyright law and by Utica University policy. I am the exclusive owner of the copyright in those materials I create. You may take notes and make copies of course materials for your own use. You may also share those materials with another student who is registered and enrolled in this course.
 
 * You may not reproduce, distribute or display (post/upload) lecture notes or recordings or course materials in any other way — whether or not a fee is charged — without my express written consent. You also may not allow others to do so. If you do so, you may be subject to student conduct proceedings under the Utica University Student Code of Conduct

## Homework

 Homework assignments come in two different formats. 
  
  * The first kind is online homework assignment at WileyPLUS (Please get the access as soon as you can). There will be one WileyPLUS homework each week. To earn credit, you must earn more than 90% on each assignment. You have 10 attempts for each question and that should be plenty before you can answer the question correctly. Each assignment is worth 1 point. WileyPLUS homework's deadline are scheduled much later in the semester. There will be no extension for WileyPLUS homework.
  
  * The second kind is completing tasks in the course materials assigned every week. You will be working on these assignments during the class time and discuss them with your peers. You will be asked to present your work during the class as part of the evaluations. 

## Group Participation

During the class, you will be actively working in a small group with your peer classmates. Here are a few tips on how to be a productive group member:
* Be helpful when your peer has a question. Also don't hesitate to ask if you have a question. The best way to learn something is to teach it.
* It is common that the class time is not enough for you to complete all the activities, so it would be a good idea to get together with your group members between classes to work on them.
* Respect others' idea. Give everyone a chance to share their opinion. Do not dominate a conversation.

## Quizzes and Examinations

  There will be a quiz every week except for the first week. There will be one cumulative final exam.
 
## Evaluation

 In this class, we will use a system known as standards-based grading. You will have multiple opportunities to demonstrate that you have met a goal. A goal is met if a student has successfully demonstrated it twice in quizzes or final exam. There is no partial credit. Once you have score a goal from a quiz, you should put a note in one of the boxes before the relevant goal on [this](https://files.xiaopv.com/learninggoalsprecalculus.pdf) print out. You should use clear labeling to indicate when you score that goal, for example, Q2 stands for Quiz 2. If you are unsuccessful on a quiz problem, prepare yourself to do better on the next quiz. Feel free to stop by my office and ask for practice problems. The goals that will be tested on a quiz will be posted at this page earlier during the week. Doing problems and participating discussion in class, doing homework and exercises are all ways to help you prepare for the next quiz. All of goals appear on multiple quizzes so you have multiple chance to demonstrate that you have met the goals. Your final letter grade will be determined based on the following criteria.

 | Letter Grade |    Criteria                                                                                    |

## Tutoring Services
 
There are two kinds of (free) tutoring services offered by the university.

* The first kind is the tutoring service at the learning commons of library. Please visit the learning commons for detail schedules.

* The second kind is an online tutoring service provided by the university called ThinkingStorm. You can access the service [here](https://www.utica.edu/thinkingstorm) with your university username and password.

There is a third (also free) option gaining popularity among students: using generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT. Here are some examples (by no means exhaustive) of how AI can enhance your learning experience:

 * Ask ChatGPT to create a practice problem for you. Be very specific about the types of problems you're looking for.

 * Ask ChatGPT for a hint if you're stuck on a problem or to provide a complete step-by-step solution.

 * Ask ChatGPT to evaluate your work and check if you've answered correctly.

However, there are ways in which using AI can be harmful and even detrimental to your learning:

 * Asking ChatGPT to do your homework for you (your future employer might just hire ChatGPT instead of you).

 * Using ChatGPT to get answers without truly understanding the material, which will hinder your critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

 * While ChatGPT can provide quick responses, there is no guarantee of the quality of the information. Accepting everything ChatGPT gives you without critical reflection is like taking advice from a stranger on the street.

If you have ideas on how ChatGPT or other generative AI can help you learn, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm happy to discuss it with you.



## Academic Integrity

 I have zero tolerance on dishonesty. Any forms of dishonesty such as copying homework or cheating on quizzes and examinations, will result in zero credit for that particular assignment, and will be reported to the Academic Standards Committee. The highest penalty a student can receive is "F for cheating" for the course. There might be additional sanctions by the Academic Standards Committee such as dismissal from the university. See Utica University official [page](https://www.utica.edu/academic/facultyinfo/intellectualdishonesty.cfm) for Academic Honesty for more details.

## Special Accommodation

 The stuff just below is the University approved language, and is a bit... "legalese''.  The point is, if you need accommodations to succeed in this course, talk to me and we can make sure you get what you need. And the social environment of this course is important to me, too. Let us work together to make a welcoming and affirming space for everyone.

 Any student who has need of special accommodations in this class due to a documented disability should speak with me as soon as possible, preferably within the first two weeks of class. You should also contact Judy Borner, Director of Learning Services in the Academic Support Services Center (315-792-3032 or jcborner@utica.edu ) in order to determine eligibility for services and to receive an accommodation letter. We will work with you to help you in your efforts to master the course content in an effective and appropriate way. See Utica University official [page](https://www.utica.edu/student/development/learning/) for Office of Learning Services.
