## General Course Information and Policies
* Course name: MAT 151 Precalculus
* Course credit hours: 3 credit
* Course Prerequisite: MAT 124, or satisfactory performance in the math placement test administered by the math department, or permission of instructor.
* Class time and location: MWF 10:30 a.m. - 11:20 a.m. (Section A) or MWF 11:30 a.m. - 12:20 p.m. at Hubbard Hall 207.
* Textbook: Please see the course material link above.
* Online homework system: We will use the WebAssign online homework system designed for Ron Larson's Precalculus textbook. You do not need to purchase the hard copy of Ron Larson's Precalculus textbook. If you want to have that textbook as a reference, you will have the access to an electronic version of it after you have purchase the WebAssign access. The ISBN for the WebAssign standalone access card is 9781337879613. You can also purchase the access directly from the publisher at [www.webassign.net](https://www.webassign.net). Note that it is very unlikely that any used Precalculus textbook will come with the WebAssign access.The class key you need to self-enroll in WebAssign is "utica 9798 5699". Please use your Utica College official name and email address to register at WebAssign. Do not use nickname or your private email address. If you have not purchased the access card or have purchased it but have not received it, please still go ahead and register as soon as possible as the WebAssign website will have a grace period and you can start to work on homework problems immediately.
* Calculator: We will be using a free graphing calculator app called Desmos. You can use Desmos directly by going to their website at [www.desmos.com](https://www.desmos.com/calculator). You are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop or a tablet (with a minimum 7" screen) to class in order to use Desmos effectively. You can download Desmos at [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desmos-graphing-calculator/id653517540?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.desmos.calculator&amp;hl=en")
* Course description: Precalculus covers elementary functions and their graphs including linear functions, quadratic functions, exponential functions, rational functions and trigonometric functions.
* Class organization: This course will likely be different from any other math course you have taken before. As an instructor, I will not be lecturing most of the time although I love lecturing very much. Scientific research shows that most people do not learn mathematics by listening, instead, they learn by doing it! I am sure you have said to yourself before "It looked so easy when the professor was doing it, but now I am confused when I have to do it by myself." Why? Because the knowledge belongs to your professor and does not belong to you. You do not learn the knowledge simply by hearing it once or twice from somebody else. In order for you to have a more thorough understanding of the knowledge, we will incorporate ideas from an educational philosophy called the Moore method (after R. L. Moore). More precisely, we will use inquiry-based learning. Most of the time during the class, students will be working in groups and presenting solutions that they have produced by themselves and not by other people or textbooks.
* Attendance is mandatory. Attending class meetings will have a direct impact on your learning as well as your grade. If you miss class for any reason, you are responsible for getting the information from a classmate, and checking the course web page for any handouts and assignments. You will not be able to make up the quiz for the day if you were not in class unless you have met the makeup policy below.
* Makeup policy: You can only make up a quiz or an exam if all three conditions are met:
  * You have a legitimate reason (as determined by me) with documented proof. Visit of emergency rooms due to urgent health conditions is an example of legitimate reason. Attending non-academic events, such as someone's wedding is an example of non-legitimate reason.
  * You have informed me well in advanced.
  * You can only make up the quiz or the exam after the scheduled date.
