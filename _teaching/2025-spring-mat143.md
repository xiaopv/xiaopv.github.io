## An Important Course Policy

I pride myself on having a good environment for working and learning. It is very important to me that we all treat each other with care and respect, in equal measure. I know that I ask students to take risks in class almost every day, and this can be challenging for many. I ask that you help me keep our classroom a supportive place for each of the people in it. Each of us deserves the space to bring our full, authentic selves to class and be comfortable. (Adapted from [T.J. Hitchman](https://sites.uni.edu/theron/about/).)

## General Course Information and Policies

 * Course name: MAT 143 Mathematical Analysis for Business and Economics

 * Course credit hours: 3 credit

 * Course Prerequisite: MAT 100, or satisfactory performance in the math placement test administered by the math department.

 * Class time and location: Hubbard Hall 210, Tuesdays and Thursdays 11:30pm - 12:45pm (Section A), 1:00pm - 2:15pm (Section B)

 * Textbook: Mathematical Applications for the Management, Life, and Social Sciences, 12th Edition by Ronald J. Harshbarger, James J. Reynolds, Rosemary Karr, Marilyn Massey.
 
 * Online homework system: We will use the WebAssign online homework system designed for our textbook. You do not need to purchase the hard copy of the textbook and you will have the access to an electronic version of it after you have signed up the WebAssign access. The ISBN for the WebAssign standalone access card 9780357865095. If you have enrolled in the book bundle program, then you will automatically have access to it. Otherwise, you can purchase the access directly from the publisher. Note that it is very unlikely that any used textbook will come with the WebAssign access. You can click [this](https://www.getenrolled.com/?courseKey=utica34268354) to self-enroll or use the class key "utica 3426 8354". Please use your Utica University official name and email address to register. Do not use nickname or your personal email address.

 * Calculator: We will be using a free graphing calculator app called Desmos. You can use Desmos directly by going to their website at [www.desmos.com](https://www.desmos.com/calculator). You are strongly encouraged to use Desmos on a computer or on a tablet. You can download Desmos at [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desmos-graphing-calculator/id653517540?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.desmos.calculator&amp;hl=en").

 * Course description: We will discuss various elementary functions and their applications in business. We will also cover linear programming as well as mathematics of finance.

 * Class organization: This course will likely be different from any other math course you have taken before. As an instructor, I will not be lecturing most of the time although I love lecturing very much. Scientific research shows that most people do not learn mathematics by listening, instead, they learn by doing it! I am sure you have said to yourself before "It looked so easy when the professor was doing it, but now I am confused when I have to do it by myself." Why? Because the knowledge belongs to your professor and does not belong to you. You do not learn the knowledge simply by hearing it once or twice from somebody else. In order for you to have a more thorough understanding of the knowledge, we will use a pedagogical practice called [inquiry-based learning](http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org). Most of the time during the class, students will be working in groups and sharing solutions that they have produced by themselves and not by other people or textbooks. 

 * Attendance is mandatory. Attending class meetings will have a direct impact on your learning as well as your grade. If you miss class for any reason, you are responsible for getting the information from a classmate, and checking the course web page for any handouts and assignments. You will not be able to make up the quiz for the day if you were not in class unless you have met the makeup policy below.

 * Makeup policy: You can only make up a quiz or an exam if all three conditions are met:
   * You have a legitimate reason (as determined by me) with documented proof. Visit of emergency rooms due to urgent health conditions is an example of legitimate reason. Attending non-academic events, such as someone's wedding is an example of non-legitimate reason.
   * You have informed me well in advanced.
   * You can only make up the quiz or the exam after the scheduled date.
 
## Your Role and My Role
 
 * Professor Xiao's role: I want you to succeed and I am here to help you succeed, but I cannot succeed for you! I have designed the structure of the course to help you learn. The class format will challenge you but it will be exhilarating and even fun at times. I will do what I think is the best to help you understand the material in the course.
 
 * Student's Role:
   * You are responsible for making sense of the concepts and processes in this course. Success in mathematics is less about "ability" and more about willingness to think and to work hard to make sense of things.
   * Attend every class meeting, participate whenever you can and work on the assignments outside of class.
   * Please respect the ideas and opinions of others.
   * If you are having trouble, please make an appointment to visit me.
   * Cell phones should be off or set to vibrate. Do not place a call or send a text during class, and do not answer a phone call without first leaving the room.

 You are strongly encouraged to download and print a [copy](https://files.xiaopv.com/learninggoalsbusmath.pdf) of the learning goals to record your grade.

## Homework

 Homework assignments come in two different formats. 
  
  * The first kind is online homework assignment at WebAssign. There will be one WebAssign homework for each section. To earn credit, you must earn more than 90% on each assignment. You have 5 attempts for each question and that should be plenty before you can answer the question correctly. Each assignment is worth 1 point. 
  
  * The second kind is completing problems in the course materials assigned every week. You will be working on these assignments during the class time and discuss them with your peers.

## Group Participation

During the class, you will be actively working in a small group with your peer classmates. Here are a few tips on how to be a productive group member:
* Be helpful when your peer has a question. Also don't hesitate to ask if you have a question. The best way to learn something is to teach it.
* It is common that the class time is not enough for you to complete all the activities, so it would be a good idea to get together with your group members between classes to work on them.
* Respect others' idea. Give everyone a chance to share their opinion. Do not dominate a conversation.

## Quizzes and Examinations

  There will be a quiz every week on Thursday except for the first week. There will be one cumulative final exam.
 
## Evaluation

 In this class, we will use a system known as standards-based grading. You will have multiple opportunities to demonstrate that you have met a goal. A goal is met if a student has successfully demonstrated it twice in quizzes or final exam. There is no partial credit. Once you have score a goal from a quiz, you should put a note in one of the boxes before the relevant goal on [this](https://files.xiaopv.com/learninggoalsbusmath.pdf) print out. You should use clear labeling to indicate when you score that goal, for example, Q2 stands for Quiz 2. If you are unsuccessful on a quiz problem, prepare yourself to do better on the next quiz. Feel free to stop by my office and ask for practice problems. Quizzes are scheduled on Thursdays. The goals that will be tested on a quiz will be posted at this page on Wednesday evenings. Doing problems and participating discussion in class, doing homework and exercises are all ways to help you prepare for the next quiz. All of goals appear on multiple quizzes so you have multiple chance to demonstrate that you have met the goals. Your final letter grade will be determined based on the following criteria.

 | Letter Grade |    Criteria                                         | 
 | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | 
 |      A       | at least 19 goals, and at least 18 homework points  | 
 |      A-      | at least 18 goals, and at least 17 homework points  | 
 |      B+      | at least 17 goals, and at least 16 homework points  | 
 |      B       | at least 16 goals, and at least 15 homework points  |

## Tutoring Services
 
There are two kinds of (free) tutoring services offered by the university.

* The first kind is the tutoring service at the learning commons of library. Please visit the learning commons for detail schedules.

* The second kind is an online tutoring service provided by the university called ThinkingStorm. You can access the service [here](https://www.utica.edu/thinkingstorm) with your university username and password. 

## Academic Integrity

 I have zero tolerance on dishonesty. Any forms of dishonesty such as copying homework or cheating on quizzes and examinations, will result in zero credit for that particular assignment, and will be reported to the Academic Standards Committee. The highest penalty a student can receive is "F for cheating" for the course. There might be additional sanctions by the Academic Standards Committee such as dismissal from the university. See Utica University official [page](https://www.utica.edu/academic/facultyinfo/intellectualdishonesty.cfm) for Academic Honesty for more details.

## Special Accommodation

 The stuff just below is the University approved language, and is a bit... "legalese''.  The point is, if you need accommodations to succeed in this course, talk to me and we can make sure you get what you need. And the social environment of this course is important to me, too. Let’s work together to make a welcoming and affirming space for everyone.

 Any student who has need of special accommodations in this class due to a documented disability should speak with me as soon as possible, preferably within the first two weeks of class. You should also contact Judy Borner, Director of Learning Services in the Academic Support Services Center (315-792-3032 or jcborner@utica.edu ) in order to determine eligibility for services and to receive an accommodation letter. We will work with you to help you in your efforts to master the course content in an effective and appropriate way. See Utica University official [page](https://www.utica.edu/student/development/learning/) for Office of Learning Services.
