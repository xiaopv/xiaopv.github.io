## General Course Information and Policies

 * Course name: MAT 401 Real Analysis
 * Course credit hours: 3-credit
 * Course prerequisite: MAT 305, or permission of instructor
 * Class time and location: MWF 9:30 a.m. - 10:20 a.m. at Hubbard Hall ??
 * Textbook: We will not use a textbook, but rather a task-sequence adopted for inquiry-based learning. The task-sequence is written by David Clark and myself. You are expected to work out the tasks as the semester progresses.
 * Course description: Foundations of the real number system, functions and sequences, limits and continuity.
 * Program learning goals: In accordance to the learning goals of the Department of Mathematics of Utica College, MAT 401 will introduce and reinforce students' ability of:
   * (PLG1) Reading and analyzing mathematical proofs.
   * (PLG2) Writing mathematical proofs.
   * (PLG5) Communicating mathematics in written form.
 * Course learning objectives: Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
   * understand and prove theorems about basic topological properties of the real number line using basic definitions including open and closed sets, limit points, converging and diverging sequences and monotonic sequences.
   * understand and prove the theorems about the relationships between rational numbers and infinite decimal representations of numbers.
   * understand and prove all the theorems that lead to the theorem that the real number field is the smallest complete field extension of the rational numbers.
   * understand and prove theorems about basic properties of continuous functions.
 * Class organization: This course will likely be different from any other math course you have taken before. As an instructor, I will not be lecturing most of the time although I love lecturing very much. Scientific research shows that most people do not learn mathematics by listening, instead, they learn by doing it! I am sure you have said to yourself before "It looked so easy when the professor was doing it, but now I am confused when I have to do it by myself." Why? Because the knowledge belongs to your professor and does not belong to you. You do not learn the knowledge simply by hearing it once or twice from somebody else. In order for you to have a more thorough understanding of the knowledge, we will incorporate ideas from an educational philosophy called the Moore method (after R. L. Moore). More precisely, we will use the modified Moore method, also known as inquiry-based learning. Most of the time during the class, students will be presenting proofs of theorems that they have produced by themselves, and not by other people or textbooks. A significant portion of your grade will be determined by how much mathematics you produce.
 * You should not look to resources outside the context of this course for help. That is, you should not be consulting the web, other texts, other faculty, or students outside of our course. On the other hand, you may use each other, the course notes, me, and your own intuition.
 * Regular attendance is mandatory and is vital to success in this course, but you will not explicitly be graded on attendance. Yet, repeated absences may impact your participation grade.
