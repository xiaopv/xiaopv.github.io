This page contains logistical information for virtual classes during the school closure due to the outbreak of COVID19. Students who are currently taking MAT 151 Precalculus and MAT 201 Calculus 1 should read this page very carefully! This document will be updated to include the latest information and decision. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to email me.

## Syllabus Updates
 
 * As of Mar. 13, 2020, no changes have been made to the syllabus. Please refer to the course home page for syllabus information such as homework assignment and quiz. Further updates will be posted here.

## Online Classes

 * Regular on-ground classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays will be replaced with online virtual classes. We will use Zoom as our platform. The course home page contains a link "Online Class". Please use the same link to connect to the virtual classes for the rest of the semester. 
 * When you join the online classes, please use your official name in the form of First Last. Even it is possible to use phone for Zoom, I strongly discourage that if you have other means (such as desktop, laptop, or tablet). The functions are much more restricted on phones and much harder to maneuver. Please make sure you open a course notes window before you join the class, you will need to refer to that throughout the class. A good practice is to use "side-by-side" window layout, or use a separate device entirely. Switching windows/tabs too frequently will make your learning more difficult.
 * All online classes will be recorded. Recording will be posted on the course home page in the homework section.
 * Virtual classes will be opened 1 hour before the regular scheduled class time (without my presence). Consider this as a common study area. Everyone is encouraged to join to discuss homework problems with your peers.
 * When connecting to the class, make sure you connect using both audio and video. Do not turn off your camera. (If you don't have a webcam, please get in touch with me.) During the online classes, students will be automatically muted to minimize background noise. Students can ask/answer questions using multiple ways:
   * 1) Use the raise hand function. I will unmute you and you can speak.
   * 2) Type your question/answer is the chat box.
   In the breakout room, feel free to unmute yourself so that group members can have discussions. 
 * Find a place that is quiet with minimal distractions during your class time (such as your dorm or your room) if possible. Make sure that the background does not have anything that you don't want others to see.

## Weekly Quizzes

 * Weekly quizzes will be posted on the course home page in the quiz section by 5pm on Thursdays. You have until 12pm on Fridays to submit your quiz via email.
 * The easiest way to complete your quiz is to print it, complete it, scan it with your phone, and then email to me.
 * Some app suggestions for scan. If there are other apps that worked well for you, please let me know so I can list them here to help other students.
   * iPhone: Notes.
   * Android: Microsoft Office Lens, Google Drive.
 * If you have an electronic way to complete your quiz such as a tablet with a stylus, feel free to use that.
 * When you send me the completed quizzes, please make sure that it is 1) in the PDF format; 2) in the upright position (no tilted or disoriented). These are crucial steps to help me process the grading smoothly so you can get timely feedback. I will email your quiz back so you can update your goal sheet.

## Online Office Hours
 
 * I will hold online office hours the same time as scheduled (1:00pm-2:30pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays). Please use a different Zoom link to attend office hours.
 * If you cannot make this time and would like to get help, send me an email to make an appointment.

## Special Accommodation

 If there are any special needs for you to get proper access of learning online (e.g. visual/hear help), please do not hesitate to contact me so I can try to help you.

## Derivative Proficiency Test (Calculus 1 Students)

 Multiple derivative proficiency tests will be scheduled for the entire class outside of our regular meeting time. The process will be similar to weekly quizzes. I will communicate the exact time  after we have completed Section 2.6.
