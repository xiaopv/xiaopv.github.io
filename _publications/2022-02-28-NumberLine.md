Abstract: The Number Line through Guided Inquiry is designed to give future secondary teachers a deep understanding of the real numbers and functions on the reals. By presenting just that part of the subject that underlies the high school curriculum, this book offers an alternative to a standard real analysis sequence for advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students. It will give any student a much deeper understanding of the mathematics that they were taught in high school. 

Written in a guided-inquiry format, this book consists of a carefully scaffolded sequence of definitions, problems, and theorems that guides students through each topic. Readers solve the problems and prove the theorems on their own and present their results to their peers with the instructor as a mentor and a guide. Students will learn not only the mathematics, but also how to help others learn mathematics. They will learn to think creatively and to make compelling arguments to justify their conclusions. They will learn to listen critically to others and give constructive feedback. Ultimately, they will learn to work as a team to answer the bigger questions and build a common understanding of the broader subject.
