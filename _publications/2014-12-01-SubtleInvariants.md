Abstract: Vasiu proved that the level torsion <var>l<sub>M</sub></var> of an <var>F</var>-crystal <var>M</var> over an algebraically closed field of characteristic <var>p>0</var> is a non-negative integer that is an effectively computable upper bound of the isomorphism number <var>n<sub>M</sub></var> of <var>M</var> and expected that in fact one always has <var>n<sub>M</sub> = l<sub>M</sub></var>. In this paper, we prove that this equality holds.
