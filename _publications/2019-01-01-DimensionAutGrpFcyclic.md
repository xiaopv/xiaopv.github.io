Abstract: In this paper we develop a combinatorial formula that calculates the dimension $\gamma_{\mathcal{M}_{\pi}}(m)$ of the automorphism group and the number of connected components of the endomorphism group of $F$-cyclic $F$-crystal $\mathcal{M}_{\pi}$ over an algebraically closed field defined by some permutation $\pi$ at finite level $m$. As an application, it provides an explicit formula for calculating the dimension $\gamma_{\mathcal{M}}(m)$ for all isosimple minimal $F$-crystals $\mathcal{M}$. We also show that for all non-ordinary Dieudonn\'e module $\mathcal{M}_{\pi}$ such that $\pi$ is a cycle, the sequence $(\gamma_{\mathcal{M}_{\pi}}(m) - \gamma_{\mathcal{M}_{\pi}}(m-1))$ is strictly decreasing for all $1 \leq m \leq n_{\mathcal{M}_{\pi}}$ where $n_{\mathcal{M}_{\pi}}$ is the isomorphism number of $\mathcal{M}_{\pi}$.
