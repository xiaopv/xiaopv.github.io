Abstract: In this paper we develop a combinatorial formula that calculates the dimension <var>&#947;<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub>(m)</var> of the automorphism group and the number of connected components of the endomorphism group of <var>F</var>-cyclic <var>F</var>-crystal <var>M<sub>&#960;</sub></var> over an algebraically closed field defined by some permutation <var>&#960;</var> at finite level <var>m</var>. As an application, it provides an explicit formula for calculating the dimension <var>&#947;<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub>(m)</var> for all isosimple minimal <var>F</var>-crystals <var>M</var>. We also show that for all non-ordinary Dieudonn√© module <var>M<sub>&#960;</sub></var> such that <var>&#960;</var> is a cycle, the sequence <var>(&#947;<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub>(m) - &#947;<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub>(m-1)) </var>  is strictly decreasing for all <var>1 &le; m &le; n<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub></var> where <var>n<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub></var> is the isomorphism number of <var>M<sub>&#960;</sub></var>
