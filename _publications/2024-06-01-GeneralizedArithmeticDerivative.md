Abstract: The arithmetic derivative is a function from the natural numbers to itself that sends all prime numbers to $1$ and satisfies the Leibniz rule. The arithmetic partial derivative with respect to a prime <var>p</var> is the <var>p</var>-th component of the arithmetic derivative. In this paper, we generalize the arithmetic partial derivative to <var>p</var>-adic fields (the local case) and the arithmetic derivative to number fields (the global case). We study the dynamical system of the <var>p</var>-adic valuation of the iterations of the arithmetic partial derivatives. We also prove that for every integer <var>n</var> greater than or equal to 0, there are infinitely many elements with exactly <var>n</var> anti-partial derivatives. In the end, we study the <var>p</var>-adic continuity of arithmetic derivatives. (This is a joint work with Brad Emmons.)
