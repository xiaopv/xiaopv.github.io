Abstract: Let <var>M<sub>&#960;</sub></var> be an <var>F</var>-cyclic <var>F</var>-crystal over an algebraically closed field defined by a permutation <var>&#960;</var> and a set of prescribed Hodge slopes. We prove combinatorial formulas for the dimension <var>&#947;<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub>(m)</var> of the automorphism group scheme of <var>M<sub>&#960;</sub></var> at finite level <var>m</var> and the number of connected components of the endomorphism group scheme of <var>M<sub>&#960;</sub></var>  at finite level <var>m</var>. As an application, we show that if <var>M<sub>&#960;</sub></var> is a nonordinary Dieudonn√© module defined by a cycle <var>&#960;</var>, then <var>&#947;<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub>(m+1) - &#947;<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub>(m) &lt; &#947;<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub>(m) - &#947;<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub>(m-1) </var> for all <var>1 &le; m &le; n<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub></var> where <var>n<sub>M<sub>&#960;</sub></sub></var> is the isomorphism number of <var>M<sub>&#960;</sub></var>.
