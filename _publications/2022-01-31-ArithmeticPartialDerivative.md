Abstract: The arithmetic partial derivative (with respect to a prime <var>p</var>) is a function from the set of integers that sends <var>p</var> to 1 and satisfies the Leibniz rule. In this paper, we prove that the <var>p</var>-adic valuation of the sequence of higher order partial derivatives is eventually periodic. We also prove a criterion to determine when an integer has integral anti-partial derivatives. As an application, we show that there are infinitely many integers with exactly <var>n</var> integral anti-partial derivatives for any nonnegative integer <var>n</var>.
