Abstract: In this paper we generalize minimal <var>p</var>‐divisible groups defined by Oort to minimal <var>F</var>‐crystals over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic. We prove a structural theorem of minimal <var>F</var>‐crystals and give an explicit formula of the Frobenius endomorphism of the basic minimal <var>F</var>‐crystals that are the building blocks of the general minimal <var>F</var>‐crystals. We then use minimal <var>F</var>‐crystals to generalize minimal heights of <var>p</var>‐divisible groups and give an upper bound of the isomorphism numbers of <var>F</var>‐crystals, whose isogeny type are determined by simple <var>F</var>‐isocrystals, in terms of their ranks, Hodge slopes and Newton slopes.
