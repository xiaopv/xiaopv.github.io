collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2012-12-01-ComputingIsomorphismNumbers.md
excerpt: 'The isomorphism number of an <var>F</var>-crystal <var>(M, \varphi)</var> over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic is the smallest non-negative integer <var>n<sub>M</sub></var> such that the <var>n<sub>M</sub></var>-th level truncation of <var>(M, \varphi)</var> determines the isomorphism class of <var>(M, \varphi)</var>. When <var>(M, \varphi)</var> is isoclinic, namely it has a unique Newton slope <var>\lambda</var>, we provide an efficiently computable upper bound for <var>n<sub>M</sub></var> in terms of <var>\lambda</var> and the Hodge slopes of <var>(M, \varphi)</var>. This is achieved by providing an upper bound for the level torsion of <var>(M, \varphi)</var> introduced by Vasiu. We also check that this upper bound is optimal for many families of isoclinic <var>F</var>-crystals that are of special interest (such as isoclinic <var>F</var>-crystals of K3 type).'
