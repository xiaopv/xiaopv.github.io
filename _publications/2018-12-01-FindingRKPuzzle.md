Abstract: Solving a Radon-Kaczmarz puzzle involves filling a square grid with positive integers, each between one and nine, satisfying certain clues coming from the sum of entries that lie on the same line in the square grid. Given a set of slopes (of a particular order) that define clues of Radon-Kaczmarz puzzles, we give an upper bound of the size such that any solvable Radon-Kaczmarz puzzle whose size is less than or equal to that is uniquely solvable.
