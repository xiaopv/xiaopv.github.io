About me

I am 

About my name
======

* In traditional Chinese, my name is written as 蕭瀟. In standard Romanization, it is spelled as Xīao Xīao with tones.
* The most difficult part of the pronunciation is the first letter "x". Ignoring the Chinese syllabic structure, Hs-iao offers a close sound in English. The "show" part of the word shower offers another close pronunciation.
* My last name 蕭 came from the name of a place called [Xiao County](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%90%A7%E5%9B%BD) (found around 681 AD). Today, Xiao County is part of [Anhui Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui) of China, although I was born in [Wuhan City](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E5%B8%82) in [Hubei Province](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B9%96%E5%8C%97%E7%9C%81).
